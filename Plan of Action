1. Suspicious Activities:
To track suspicious behavior, we would have to define a function consisting of two conditional statements:
The first conditional statement would check if any user logs into any of the systems more than 5 times in a single day.
The second conditional statement would check if the user logs into any of the systems even once between 12:00 am to 5:00 am.
Then, we will return the total count of suspicious activities.

2. Irresponsible behavior:

3. System Glitch: 

4. Domain Count:

5. Additional Insights:
We could analyze who works the most out of all of the employees by looking at the date and time that each employee logs in and logs out 
and how often they log in to the workstation server

In total, we will have at least 5 functions and one main dictionary data structure that returns all of the necessary information in each 
function, making our code way more organized.
